My name is Paul McCarty and I'm the founder of [SecureStack](https://securestack.com).  I like to describe SecureStack as the world's first DevSecOps Maturity Platform because we help our customers assess and then accelerate their DevSecOps journey.

## 💫 About Me
I am a DevSecOps evangelist and thought leader obsessed with applied application security and securing the software supply chain. I like to say that I'm a technical founder who likes to work at the intersection of product delivery and security. I have built and led multiple product delivery teams: for the government, in the private sector and for my own startup, SecureStack.

I am a frequent public speaker and have presented at many events including: OWASP, SecTalks, CrikeyCon, TuskCon, RSA, AISA, and multiple BSides.  I am a proud father, and I used to [snowboard a lot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnHD_8f5O2k&list=PLap8pGxdE173KGgnzBJGxFIlVSjODg_mz)

## My Projects

### [The DevSecOps Playbook](https://github.com/6mile/DevSecOps-Playbook)

I wrote the DevSecOps Playbook in 2022 as a step-by-step guide for organizations to implement DevSecOps
programs regardless of their size or industry.

### [Visualizing the Software Supply Chain](https://github.com/SecureStackCo/visualizing-software-supply-chain)

The software supply chain is under increasing attack, but there is no industry standard dejnition of what the
software supply chain is. /ow can we hope to secure the SSC if we don't know what's in it( This proUect is my
attempt at creating a common dejnition to help organizations understand the scope and breadth of the SSC.

### [Open Software Supply Chain Attack Reference](https://pbom.dev)
OSC&R is a comprehensive, systematic and actionable way to understand attacker behaviors and techniques
with respect to the software supply chain. It is a matrix style document modeled on the MITRE ATT&CK matrix.
I am a contributing member to the project.

### [Minimal Viable Secure Product](https://mvsp.dev)
The Minimal Viable Secure Product FMVSP􀁊 is a minimum security baseline for enterprise-ready products and
services. The baseline checklist can be used at various stages of the sales cycle, from R􀁋P through to contractual
controls. I am an original contributing member.
